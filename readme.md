# Make NES music with LMMS
LMMS has a module named **Nescaline** that reproduce NES sound.
We are going to use this free music production software, to make music, 8bit style!

* First we will see how to get a premade session for nes music
* Then we will learn how to create a pattern
* Finally, we will see how to create a song

# NES Session
We are going to use a premade session for lmms.
